  <h2>Why are we so angry?</h2>

  <p><i>An intimate documentary about the invisible barriers that hinder women’s professional growth. Director Eva Lammelová, together with expert Šárka Homfray, uncovers the glass ceilings through the stories of several women.</i></p>

  <p>
    The Authorial Documentary Why Are We So Angry explores the invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing in their careers – the so-called glass ceilings. Director Eva Lammelová, through personal conversations with lawyer and gender expert Šárka Homfray, and through her own story and the stories of three to six women, gradually uncovers how deeply these obstacles affect both professional and personal lives. The film is both personal and social – connecting individual experience with a broader picture of structural and invisible inequalities.
    <br>
    <br>
    The conversations with the protagonists are not only testimonies of injustice but also records of a quiet struggle for self-respect, recognition, and the right to be heard. Each woman faces a different type of barrier: discrimination due to motherhood, single parenthood, the queen bee phenomenon, undervalued work, limited career progression, or distrust from management.
    <br>
    <br>
    The dialogue between the director and Šárka Homfray frames the individual stories and provides both expert and human context. Eva brings into the film her own experience as a woman and mother trying to succeed in the professional world of audiovisual production – a field that itself reflects gender imbalance. The camera moves in intimate proximity, capturing gestures, silences, and small moments of uncertainty that often speak louder than words.
    <br>
    <br>
    A layered, introspective film about visibility, loyalty, and courage – about how difficult it is to cross the line between having talent and having opportunity. The film exposes a system that appears fair on the surface but in reality keeps women beneath it.
    <br>
    <br>
    The film invites viewers not only to look at the phenomenon of glass ceilings but also to feel what it’s like to live under them.

    Globally, women make up about 50% of university graduates, but only 10–20% of top leadership positions. In the EU, women constitute around 31% of board members of large companies (2023, after the introduction of quotas) and 8–10% of CEOs. In the Czech Republic, women earn about 17.9% less than men. Women represent roughly 27% of managers in the Czech Republic and only 11% of executive roles.
